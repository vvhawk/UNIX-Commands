# UNIX Commands
This project was completed for my university class on [systems](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-214-systems-programming).

We implemented common UNIX commands used to manage system files and directories (ls, find, tree) in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).

All code was developed and tested remotely on Rutgers [Instructional Lab Machines](https://report.cs.rutgers.edu/nagiosnotes/iLab-machines.html). Remote connection was established using [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell).
