# UNIX Commands
I completed this project for my university class on [systems](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-214-systems-programming)

Implemented common UNIX commands (ls, find, tree) used to manage system files and directories

All code was developed and tested remotely on Rutgers [Instructional Lab Machines](https://report.cs.rutgers.edu/nagiosnotes/iLab-machines.html). Remote connection was established using SSH.
